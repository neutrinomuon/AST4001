This catalogue is based on eyeball classification of the galaxies in the CALIFA 
mothersample by the CALIFA collaboration. It contains the same information as the 
file CALIFA_2_MS_class.csv. However, it presents the result in a slightly
different way in that morphological classification has been turned from a 
character into an integer constant using the following transformation:
